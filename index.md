# spectrum
A practice of making mel spectrogram, CNN autoencode pre-training, and classifier by deep learning
## Usage
1.making mel spectrogram

Download the english number 0-9 speech data,  <http://pannous.net/files/spoken_numbers_wav.tar>  
(See Description of Data in <https://github.com/AKBoles/Deep-Learning-Speech-Recognition/blob/master/Pannous-Walkthrough.md> )  
and move wav files to wav directory. Steffi were removed due to it may soemthing wrong. 
```
python make_spectrogram.py
```
Mel scale of FFT size, shift size, bands number, max-min frequecny are adjustable at class GetSpecgram __init__  
Some input wav file of slow utterance (xxx40 <=) or fast utterance (xxx260 >=)  were rejected  
spectrogram.zip is an example of output spectrogram directory.

2.making DataSet  

each data and label for classifier and autoencoder   
```
python make_dataset.py
```
  

3.classifier by deep learning framework Chainer

 two cnn layers model  
```
python cnn_classifier1-2cnn.py
```
![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36104188/36150172-24283bb8-1106-11e8-9bb4-8cccb62466b7.png)

 three cnn layers model  
```
python cnn_classifier1-3cnn.py
```


4. CNN-Autoencoder by deep learning framework Chainer  
Customized chainer extensions of Updater, Evaluator, and plot_figure are used.  
input->encoder-> decoder ->output   
```
python cnn_autoencoder1.py
```
![sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36104188/36150167-20d228f2-1106-11e8-9d68-f0a2b217f112.png)
